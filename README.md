## ðŸ¤– Algorithmic Trading

**Goal:** Compete in the IMC Prosperity rounds using fully automated trading bots.

### How It Works
- Algo trading: each round prosperity will give us different commodities and different rules. And we need to build a trading bot within 4 days.
- Manual trading: make a model to predict other player's decision and maximizing our profit.


### Running Algo Bots
